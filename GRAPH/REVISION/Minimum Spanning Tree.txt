âœ… Firt let's understand what is  a spanning tree.......?
Given a connected graph G(V,E)
Spanning Tree......?
-> it has all the vertices of G
->it has (v-1) no of edges

âœ… Note : Since spanning tree is a tree  , it will have no cycle.

âœ… Now what is a minimum weight spanning tree.......?

 for MST , graph must be weighted and connected,

ðŸ’€Out of all the  spanning trees possible for a graph .....MST is the one which has the minimum possible weight.

 
âœ… For finding MST of a given  graph , u can use any of these two below algorithms

1.Kruskal's algorithm
2.Prim's algorithm
