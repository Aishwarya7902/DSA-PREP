☑️Bellman ford algo is used to find minimum distance from source to all other node.

☑️Now you ask me that Dijkstra's did the same na .......then why to learn Bellman,
☑️The ans is , Dijkstra's can't work when we have negative edges or negative cycle.
☑️If you want to learn more watch this:

☑️Here comes Bellman Ford to rescue us..................it can work on negative edges too.....provided it is a directed graph

☑️Note 💀: Bellman Ford can work only in  directed graph

☑️Bellman ford says relax the edges for (v-1) times , and you will get the minimum ditance from source to all other nodes.


☑️To detect -ve cycle
after (v-1) relaxations......just relax for 1 more time
if u get any updataions....it means there is negative cycle.
